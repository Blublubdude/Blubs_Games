<p><b>Computer Science</b> is alot of things you use in your everyday life. It can be using computers or any type of device (ex. an analog watch, microwave, oven, even a toaster). Websites like youtube are also made by computer science. There are two pieces computer science, the first one is hardware and the second is software. Both of these are crucial to making a device. Hardware is the pieces that make a computer and software is the code that make the interactive bit of the device. <b>For Example:</b> If I made a super computer but it doesn't have software, what would it even do? The same is for software, if I make a very easy and interative UI but I don't have any hardware to run it on, then why would i make it? Today we will be focusing on both bits and will even show a game! The first bit will be about the hardware and how a computer works. The second bit will on the coding side and some intructions on how you can make your own game in scratch. </p>

        Computers are very complex machines made up of various components such as CPUs, GPUs, RAM, storage drive, cpu fan cooler, and a motherboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main parts of a computer to make it turn on are the <b>motherboard, RAM, CPU, and GPU</b>.

        A <b>motherboard</b> is a part that sends signals to all the other components. 
        For example, if I wanted to send a file from my computer to a USB stick, the first it would do is send the size of the file would be sent to the USB alongside the name 
and extension (e.g., program.exe - 253 megabytes or 337,500 bytes). Then, the code for the file would be sent to the USB. 
It is similar to getting off a plane and picking up your luggage. The difference is that you are the file, and the luggage is the code. The motherboard acts like the nerves in a body. The reason why the motherboard is like nerves is because it sends and receives terabytes of data in its lifetime (usually about 4 to 5 years for a laptop, but for a desktop, 5 to 8 years). <blockquote><blockquote><img src="motherboard.png" description="This image shows how a motherboard looks"></blockquote></blockquote>

        A <b>Central Processing Unit</b> (also known as a <b>CPU</b>) is a core that processes everything you give it. It processes the commands and sends 
        all its outputs to the necessary components. For example, if the user opens a new tab, the CPU will process that and send an output to the screen 
        to show the new tab. Think of the CPU as your brain. The brain performs complex calculations, and the CPU does the same for the computer. 
        Your brain tells your body what to do, and the CPU tells the computer parts what to do. The only difference is that the CPU communicates in 
        machine code and binary. I will explain more in the later paragraphs.

        A <b>Graphical Processing Unit</b> (GPU) is a unit that displays the image that the CPU tells it to show. The GPU is a nessisity becuse of it's of displays and high performance if you have a moniter or screen, if you dont have a GPU then the screen wont turn on (well it would but wont display anything).
        A GPU also can teach an AI lots of things such as sign, communications & to tell the user step by step instructions. It also helps to display 
        videos and inages and create them too.
