        Computers are very complex machines made up of various components such as CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and a motherboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main parts of a computer are the motherboard, RAM, CPU, and GPU.

    <p>
        A <b>motherboard</b> is a part that sends signals to all the other components. 
        For example, if I wanted to send a file from my computer to a USB stick, first, the size of the file would be sent to the USB alongside the name 
        and extension (e.g., program.exe - 253 megabytes or 337,500 bytes). Then, the code for the file would be sent to the USB. 
        It is similar to getting off a plane and picking up your luggage. The difference is that you are the file, and the luggage is the code. 
        The motherboard acts like the nerves in a body. The reason why the motherboard is like nerves is because it sends and receives terabytes of data 
        in its lifetime (usually about 4 to 5 years for a laptop, but for a desktop, 5 to 8 years).

    <p>
        A <b>Central Processing Unit</b> (also known as a <b>CPU</b>) is a core that processes everything you give it. It processes the commands and sends 
        all its outputs to the necessary components. For example, if the user opens a new tab, the CPU will process that and send an output to the screen 
        to show the new tab. Think of the CPU as your brain. The brain performs complex calculations, and the CPU does the same for the computer. 
        Your brain tells your body what to do, and the CPU tells the computer parts what to do. The only difference is that the CPU communicates in 
        machine code and binary. I will explain more in the later paragraphs.

        A <b>Graphical Processing Unit</b> (GPU) is a unit that displays the image that the CPU instructs it to show. GPU are a nessisity becuse of it's of displays and high performance if you have a moniter or screen, if you dont have a GPU then the screen wont turn on (well it would but wont display anything).
